# Dark-Squirrel-Scripts short DScript is a Squirrel based code for the released games Thief 1&2 and it's editor DromEd.

Beside the basic included scripts DScript is the fourth largest collection of scripts made by the comumnity over the past years.
With the 2017's update of the game to the NewDark Version 1.25 it was possible to now write scripts in squirrel simply in a text editor with the game compiling then compiling them during runtime.

The DScript can be used as a framework for your own scripts providing various helpfull functions for example grabbing parameters and especially the DBaseTrap script which generally manages all the messages and universal parameters like repeats or delays for nearly all scipts included.

Besides one or two  script ideas I'm about to add the DScript is nearly 'finished' by my side. So I'm open for new ideas and requests.
