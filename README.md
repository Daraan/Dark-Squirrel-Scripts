# Dark-Squirrel-Scripts short DScript is a Squirrel based code for the 1998 and 2000 released games Thief 1&2 and its editor DromEd.

Beside the basic included scripts DScript is now one of the four largest collection of scripts made by the community over the past years.
With the 2017 update of the game to the NewDark Version 1.25 it is now possible to write scripts in the squirrel language simply in a text editor which is later compiled by the game.

By design the DScript can be used as a framework for your own scripts. It provides various helpfull functions for example grabbing parameters and especially the DBaseTrap script which generally manages all the messages and universal parameters like repeats or delays for nearly all scipts included.

Besides one or two  script ideas I'm about to say that the DScript is nearly 'finished'. So I'm open for new ideas and requests.
